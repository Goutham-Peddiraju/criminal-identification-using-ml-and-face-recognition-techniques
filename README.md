Criminal identification remains a critical challenge for law enforcement agencies, and advancements in machine learning (ML) and face recognition technologies are revolutionizing this field. The study titled "Criminal Identification Using Machine Learning and Face Recognition Techniques" explores how these modern technologies can be harnessed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of criminal identification processes. This research focuses on integrating machine learning algorithms with advanced face recognition systems to improve the precision of identifying suspects and verifying identities. By employing techniques such as deep learning-based facial feature extraction and classification, the study demonstrates how these technologies can process and analyze large datasets of facial images with high accuracy. The paper highlights various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are applied to detect and match facial features against criminal databases. Additionally, it addresses the challenges of varying lighting conditions, facial expressions, and demographic differences, and proposes solutions to mitigate these issues. The results show significant improvements in identification rates and reduced false positives, offering a promising approach to modernizing criminal identification methods. This research underscores the potential of combining machine learning and face recognition to enhance public safety and streamline investigative processes.
